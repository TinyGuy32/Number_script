everything here that has a dot after it needs a dot after it to work

you also need to remember to put your code files in the same directory as my .py file 
you can just put yor code in a .txt files and then write the file name in my .py program

@varName_Number.           creates a variable with the name varName and value Number
#thing.                               prints a thing
$varName<                        how you use a variable when defining another variable or just printing it. exempel:(#$var1<.)
+var1_var2_var3.               stores the sum of var2 and var 3 in var 1
-var1_var2_var3.                 subtracts var3 from var2 and stores it in var1
/var1_var2_var3.                 divides var2 by var3 and stores it in var1
*var1_var2_var3.                multiplies var2 by var3 and stores it in var1
=var1_var2_var3.               sets var1 to 1 if var2 is equal to var3 and to 0 if theyre not
<var1_var2_var3.               sets var1 to 1 if var2 is more than var3 and to 0 if it is not
>var1.                               stores user input to var1
?varName[                          
code.                                 dose the code in the square brackets if varName is 1  
]                                        
@varName_[string]             saves the text in the square brackets as a string to variable varName,
,                                          to set the point to go back to
'.                                         to go back to the set point
